## App interface

Type the ticker alias into the input field then push search. However, the list of search results updated continuously.

In order to add a ticker to your favourite list, push the outlined Star button (it's visiable once your mouse hovers the ticker card).

The same applies to removing a ticker from your favourites; push the solid Star button. You may perform this action while both in Tickers and Starred tickers sections.
